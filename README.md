# My Todo App

Hi! This is my Todo App. I made it so I can remember all the things I need to do, like homework, cleaning my room, or feeding my fish. üêü

## Techstacks used :
HTML
CSS 
Javascript

## How to Use
1. Type what you need to do in the box.
2. Click the "Add" button and it will show up in the list.
3. When you finish something, you can check it off!
4. If you want to delete something, just click the trash can.
5. You can also download your list or clear everything if you want to start over.

## Why I Made This
Because sometimes I forget things, and this app helps me remember. Plus, it's fun to check things off!

## Colors
I picked bright colors because they make me happy. üåà

## Thank you for looking at my app!
